# Breadth First Search
This is a sorting algorithm that runs on graphs and is helpful for answering two types of questions"
```
1. Is there a path from node A to node B
2. What is the shortest path from node A to node B?
```

## Implementation

Start at the root node adn explores are nodes present at that depth prior to moving onto nodes at the next depth level.
