# Trie

Trie is an interesting data structure where strings/characters are indexed to look up values. This allows for searching along the data structure.
Tries are composed of nodes that contain links which point to other nodes or none.

Why use a Trie over a Hash Table?

- Do not have O(n) worst case which collisions occur on insertion as it does not rely on a hashing function. so depending on the key set Tries could be a better choice.
